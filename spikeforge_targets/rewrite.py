"""Execute a target's declared substitutions to build a target-ready graph.

The declared :attr:`TargetSpec.substitutions` mapping stays the source of
truth for *which* rewrites apply; this module only consumes it. Every node
the target does not support natively lands in exactly one report bucket: a
declared and executable substitution is **applied**, a declared substitution
with no rule is **skipped**, and a primitive with no declaration is
**unfixable**. Nothing is dropped, and the original graph is left untouched.

When a spike fixture is supplied the rewritten graph is executed by the
reference interpreter alongside the original and the measured drift is folded
into the report, so a lossy substitution is quantified rather than hidden.
