"""Apply a target's declared quantization to a graph's weights.

The ``quantization`` entry in :attr:`TargetSpec.constraints` stays the source
of truth for *which* scheme applies; this module only consumes it. A target
that declares ``none`` yields an unchanged graph and a no-op report, an
unknown scheme is reported unapplied rather than guessed, and a supported
scheme quantizes every weight-bearing node, recording per-layer before/after
ranges and (when a spike fixture is supplied) the measured drift. No device or
backend is involved, so a device-quantized result is never claimed.
