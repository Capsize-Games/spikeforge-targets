"""Map operation counts to a target's declared energy/latency estimate.

The counts come from the event-driven runtime; this layer only turns them into
an honest report. A target with a bundled cost table yields an estimate
(``estimate: true``), a target with none reports ``basis: "unavailable"`` and
``None`` numbers, and a device-reported measurement flips the report to
``estimate: false``. Nothing is ever presented as measured without a device.
